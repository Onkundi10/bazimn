    <h2>Dispute & Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>We understand that disputes may arise. This policy outlines how disputes and refund requests are handled on Bazimn.</p>
    <h3>Eligibility</h3>
    <p>Buyers may request a refund if the seller fails to deliver the agreed services, delivers defective work, or cancels without notice. Sellers may dispute refund claims if services were delivered as agreed.</p>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>Disputes must be initiated through the platform within a reasonable time after delivery. Both parties can submit evidence. Our support team will review the information and decide the outcome.</p>
    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Possible outcomes include a full refund to the buyer, a partial refund split between the buyer and seller, or release of all funds to the seller. Our decision is final unless escalated to arbitration or legal proceedings.</p>
    <h3>Chargebacks</h3>
    <p>If a buyer initiates a chargeback through their payment provider, seller funds related to that order will be frozen until the matter is resolved. Abuse of chargebacks may result in account suspension.</p>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy or need help with a dispute, please contact support.</p>
