    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>The following terms govern your use of the Bazimn marketplace. By accessing or using our site, you agree to these terms.</p>
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Bazimn provides an online platform that connects buyers and sellers of digital and local services. We act as an intermediary and are not the provider of the services listed on the platform.</p>
    <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use our services. You agree to comply with all applicable laws.</p>
    <h3>3. User accounts</h3>
    <p>To access certain features, you must register an account. You agree to provide accurate information and keep your credentials secure. You may not create multiple accounts or share your account with others.</p>
    <h3>4. Marketplace rules</h3>
    <p>All gigs and custom offers must comply with our <a href="/prohibited.html">Prohibited Services</a> policy. Payments must be processed through the platform and you agree not to circumvent our fees.</p>
    <h3>5. Fees and payments</h3>
    <p>Buyers pay a service fee and sellers pay a commission on each order. Payments are held in escrow until the order is completed. Details are provided during checkout.</p>
    <h3>6. Cancellations and disputes</h3>
    <p>In the event of a dispute or cancellation, our <a href="/disputes.html">Dispute & Refund Policy</a> applies. We may refund the buyer, split funds between the parties or release funds to the seller based on our assessment.</p>
    <h3>7. Intellectual property</h3>
    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, the seller retains ownership of their work until full payment is released. Upon completion, the seller grants the buyer a license to use the deliverables. You may not reproduce or distribute content from the platform without permission.</p>
    <h3>8. Prohibited conduct</h3>
    <p>You agree not to engage in fraud, harassment, spamming or any activity that violates laws or third‑party rights. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate our terms.</p>
    <h3>9. Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p>Bazimn is not responsible for the quality, accuracy or legality of services provided by sellers. We provide the platform “as is” and our liability is limited to the amount of fees you paid to us.</p>
    <h3>10. Termination</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your account at any time for violation of these terms. Upon termination, existing orders may be cancelled and funds returned or paid out as appropriate.</p>
    <h3>11. Governing law and dispute resolution</h3>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of Kenya. Any disputes arising out of these terms will be resolved in the courts of Nairobi, Kenya unless otherwise agreed.</p>
